# Program 4

See instructions here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/courses/cs220/assignments/program-4.html

## Usage Instructions

Please tell us how to build and run your code. This needs to be just a few lines, and must work on the department Linux machines. Here's a sample:

My program, cool_prog, does really cool things. It uses the pthread library and takes in three arguments. See the following instructions for building and running it:

```
// if compiled on terminal
cd project-directory
g++ -g -Wall -o logger logger.cpp
./logger
// can close terminal while running and keeps working
```
```
// if compiled on command prompt
cd project-directory
g++ -Wall -o -static-libstdc++ logger.cpp
-static-libstdc++ on command prompt, otherwise run executable
// will only run while window or command prompt stays open
```
