# Program 4

See instructions here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/courses/cs220/assignments/program-4.html

## Usage Instructions

Please tell us how to build and run your code. This needs to be just a few lines, and must work on the department Linux machines. Here's a sample:

My program, cool_prog, does really cool things. It uses the pthread library and takes in three arguments. See the following instructions for building and running it:

```
cd project-directory
gcc -Wall -pthread my_cool_program.c -o cool_prog
./cool_prog arg1 arg2 'hello world'
```
